# Browser Sign In Example

This example shows you how to use the [Okta OIDC Library][] to authenticate a user. Authentication is done with the browser [Chrome Custom Tabs] [], which open Okta login web-page. After the user authenticates in browser, they are redirected back to the application and exchanging the received code for tokens and persist them.

## Prerequisites

Before running this sample, you will need the following:

* An Okta Developer Account, you can sign up for one at https://developer.okta.com/signup/.
* An Okta Application, configured for Mobile app.
    1. After login, from the Admin dashboard, navigate to **Applications**&rarr;**Add Application**
    2. Choose **Native** as the platform
    3. Populate your new Native OpenID Connect application with values similar to:

        | Setting              | Value                                               |
        | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
        | Application Name     | Native OpenId Connect App *(must be unique)*        |
        | Login URI            | com.okta.example:/callback                          |
        | End Session URI      | com.okta.example:/logoutCallback                    |
        | Allowed grant types  | Authorization Code, Refresh Token *(recommended)*   |

    4. Click **Finish** to redirect back to the *General Settings* of your application.
    5. Copy the **Client ID**, as it will be needed for the client configuration.
    6. Get your issuer, which is a combination of your Org URL (found in the upper right of the console home page) and /oauth2/default. For example, https://dev-1234.oktapreview.com/oauth2/default.

**Note:** *As with any Okta application, make sure you assign Users or Groups to the application. Otherwise, no one can use it.*

### Configuration

#### Setup configuration file 
Create a file called `okta_app_auth_config.json` in your application's `res/raw/` directory with
the following contents:

```json
{
  "client_id": "{clientId}",
  "redirect_uri": "{redirectUri}",
  "end_session_redirect_uri": "{endSessionUri}",
  "scopes": [
    "openid",
    "profile",
    "offline_access"
  ],
  "discovery_uri": "https://{yourOktaDomain}"
}
```

```java
OIDCConfig config = new OIDCConfig.Builder()
    .withJsonFile(this, R.id.okta_app_auth_config)
    .create();
```

**Notes:**
- `discovery_uri` can be customized for specific authorization servers. See [Discovery URI Guidance](https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-android#discovery-uri-guidance) for more info.
- To receive a **refresh_token**, you must include the `offline_access` scope.
- `end_session_redirect_uri` is a mandatory parameter.

#### Update the URI Scheme

In order to redirect back to your application from a web browser, you must specify a unique URI to
your app. To do this, you must define a gradle manifest placeholder in your app's `build.gradle`:

```java
android.defaultConfig.manifestPlaceholders = [
    "appAuthRedirectScheme": "com.okta.example"
]
```

Make sure this is consistent with the redirect URI used in `okta_app_auth_config.json`. For example,
if your **Redirect URI** is `com.okta.example:/callback`, the **AppAuth Redirect Scheme** should be
`com.okta.example`.

## Dependencies

This sample use [Okta OIDC Library] dependency in `build.gradle` file:

```bash
implementation 'com.okta.android:oidc-androidx:1.0.16'
```

## Running This Example

You can open this sample into Android Studio or build it using gradle.
```bash
cd browser-sign-in
./gradlew app:assembleRelease
```

**BroserSignInActivity.java** - implementation authentication process.
**UserInfoActivity.java** - get user info, log out.
